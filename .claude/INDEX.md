**Development Workflows:**

- **[dev](commands/dev.md)**
  - Start development server and open in browser
- **[build](commands/build.md)**
  - Build application for production deployment
- **[commit](commands/commit.md)**
  - Stage files and create conventional commit

**Knowledge Garden Workflows:**

- **[learn](commands/learn.md)**
  - Extract lessons from conversation and git history
- **[remember](commands/remember.md)**
  - Capture patterns and decisions in the knowledge garden
- **[cultivate](commands/cultivate.md)**
  - Maintain and organize the knowledge garden
- **[plan](commands/plan.md)**
  - Update PLAN.md with current status and next steps

### Templates (`templates/`)

  - Template for pull request descriptions
- **[Issue Template](templates/issue-template.md)**
  - Template for GitHub issues

### Troubleshooting (`troubleshooting/`)

Common issues and solutions.

**Planned** (will be documented as we encounter issues):

- Dev Server Issues
- Build Errors
- TypeScript Errors
- Deployment Issues

## 🌱 Future Growth Areas

As we build the application, we'll add:

### Architecture (`architecture/`)

- System design and technology decisions
- Data flow diagrams
- API design patterns
- Database schema design

### Patterns (`patterns/`)

- Reusable solutions to common problems
- Vue component patterns
- Composable patterns
- Error handling patterns
- Type-safe API communication

### Standards (`standards/`)

- Coding standards (Nuxt/Vue/TypeScript)
- Testing standards
- Git workflow
- Environment & secrets management

### Quick References (`quick-references/`)

- API endpoints reference
- Environment variables guide
- Deployment guide
- Common commands cheatsheet

## 🔄 Maintenance

The knowledge garden is a living document. It should be:

- **Updated** after significant work or decisions
- **Pruned** to remove outdated information
- **Organized** to keep related information together
- **Accessible** with clear navigation and cross-references

Use the `/cultivate` command to maintain the garden regularly.

## 📖 How to Use This Index

1. **Starting a new task?** Check the relevant section for patterns and standards
2. **Made a decision?** Document it using the decision record template
3. **Learned something?** Use `/remember` to capture it in the garden
4. **Finished a task?** Use `/learn` to extract lessons
5. **Weekly maintenance?** Use `/cultivate` to keep the garden healthy

## 🤝 Contributing to the Garden

When adding new knowledge:

1. Choose the appropriate category (or create a new one)
2. Use clear, descriptive filenames
3. Include cross-references to related documents
4. Update this index
5. Follow the markdown formatting conventions

See [GARDENING.md](../GARDENING.md) for detailed guidance on knowledge management.
